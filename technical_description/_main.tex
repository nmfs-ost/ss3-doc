The Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) assessment program provides a statistical framework for calibration of a population dynamics model using a diversity of fishery and survey data. SS is designed to deal with both age- and size-structure with multiple stock sub-areas and multiple growth patterns. The description here details the most commonly applied features, along with a subset of the more advanced options offered by SS3.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The factors described here are those that control the rate at which new individuals recruit to the population each time step; the rate at which they die due to fishing and natural mortality; and the rate at which they grow and contribute to the total biomass and reproductive potential of the stock. The total population can be divided among one to many entities. The total of all entities born within a year are referred to as a year-class or cohort. Each of the biologically- or birthseason- delineated entities is referred to as a morph. In addition, each morph can be sub-divided into slow-, medium-, and fast-growing entities termed platoons \textbf{(Goodyear 1996; Taylor and Methot 2012)}. The model description here does not include subscripting for morphs or platoons in an attempt for simplicity, but each of these entities is tracked in the population dynamics and biology if the user chooses to invoke these features. Each cohort/morph/platoon is split into males and females if the user invokes a two-sex configuration, and the subscript for gender is included in the description below.

The population in the initial year of a SS application can be simply an unfished equilibrium population, a population in equilibrium with an estimated mortality rate that is influenced by data on historical equilibrium catch, or an equilibrium population that has estimable age-specific deviations from this equilibrium for a user-specified number of the younger ages.

The numbers of animals of gender {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\gamma\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} in age group a in a virgin state ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(y=0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) is:

The plus group virgin numbers-at-age calculation is based on 3 timex the maximum age to include movement dynamics through age {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(3A-1\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. After calculating the numbers-at-age through age {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(3A\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, the numbers are collapsed to age A for subsequent calculations. Equation \ref{eqn1} use total mortality, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(Z_{\gamma,a}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} (see Equation 1.21 XX), rather than {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M_{\gamma,a}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} when the initial equilibrium also involves fishing mortality. Although this fishing mortality will reduce spawning biomass, no adjustment to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is made on premise that this reduction has probably not been occurring for enough years to effect this change. {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} serves as both the starting level of mean recruitment and as the factor that scales the mean spawner-recruitment relationship against which future annual recruitment deviations will act. An estimated offset, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_1\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, can be applied to {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. When the initial population involves agespecific deviations, these deviations are an extension of the zero-centered, lognormal recruitment deviations applied to the equilibrium numbers-at-age (see Equation 1.20 XX).

The bias-adjustment factor \textbf{(Methot and Taylor 2011)} ensures unbiased estimation of mean recruitment even during data-poor eras in which the maximum likelihood estimate of the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\tilde{R}_y\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is near 0.0.

The total annual recruitment can be partitioned among growth morphs and birth seasons and areas according to a design matrix. Each of these entities can be further divided into males and females according to a pre-specified fraction. Finally, each of these entities can be further subdivided into platoons that will have slow, medium or large size-at-age relative to the average size-at-age for the overall morph. For morphs that are designated to recruit in a season after the spawning season, their age 0 for the purposes of growth occurs at the start of that season. Thus, they will have smaller size-at-age relative to morphs of that annual cohort that are born earlier, but will grow towards the same {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_\infty\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Growth follows the von Bertalanffy function as re-formulated by \textbf{Schnute (1981)}, or by the Richards equation which has an option for a 3rd parameter to govern growth \textbf{(ADD REFERENCE)}. Growth is sex-specific. SS3 also allows for additional morphs with different growth patterns.

Mean size-at-age is calculated from growth parameters at the start of the initial year. The mean size-at-age of each morph is progressed forward according to the growth parameters active during that time period for subsequent seasons within that year and for subsequent years.

where {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{0,\gamma}^{'}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} is defined as the size at the plus-group age defined from the growth curve (Eqn. \ref{eqn5}) which is used to calculate the potential growth in the plus-group beyond the maximum age set within the model.

Equation \ref{eqn8} would logically use natural mortality as the decay factor. However, growth is calculated before natural mortality (to allow for size-specific natural mortality), so a fixed decay constant of 0.2 is used. Also, A should be large enough such that growth within the plus-group is small.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn9}
L_{y+1,\gamma,a} = L_{y,\gamma,a} + (L_{y,\gamma,a-k} - L_{\infty,\gamma}) (e^{-k_{\gamma}} - 1) \;\ \text{for $a<A$}

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The mean size at the start of the season for the plus-group is calculated based on a weighted average of fish moving into the plus-group and existing plus-group fish. This approach allows for a decline in the mean size of fish in the plus-group over time as fishing mortality reduces the numbers in the plus-group. It also prevents an instantaneous change in size of plus-group fish when growth parameters are allowed to be time-varying.

Note that size in the plus-group from Equation \ref{eqn10} will differ slightly from size in the plus-group in the initial year from Equation \ref{eqn8} if fish are still growing appreciably when they reach age {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(A\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and if the mortality factor of 0.2, in Equation \ref{eqn8} is not close to the mortality rate in the appliation.

Fish of each sex grow according to their current size and current year's {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This cohort-specific growth propagates into forecasts. Fish are not allowed to shrink if {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} declines. Provision exists for cohort-specific {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} deviations in addition to time-varying {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_1\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.
