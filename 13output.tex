\section{Output Files}

\subsection{Custom Reporting}
\hypertarget{custom}{Additional} user control for what is included in the Report.sso file was added in v.3.30.16. This approach allows for full customizing of what is printed to the Report file by selecting custom reporting (option = 3) in the starter file where specific items now can be included or excluded depending upon a list passed to SS3 from the starter file. The numbering system for each item in the Report file is as follows:

\begin{center}
	\begin{longtable}{p{1cm} p{6.5cm}p{1cm} p{6cm}}

\subsection{Standard ADMB output files}
Standard ADMB files are created by SS3. These are:

ss3.par (previously ss.par) - This file has the final parameter values. They are listed in the order they are declared in SS3. This file can be read back into SS3 to restart a run with these values (see \hyperref[sec:RunningSS3]{Running Stock Synthesis} for more info).

ss.std - This file has the parameter values and their estimated standard deviation for those parameters that were active during the model run. It also contains the derived quantities declared as standard deviation report variables. All of this information is also report in the covar.sso. Also, the parameter section of Report.sso lists all the parameters with their SS3 generated names, denotes which were active in the reported run, displays the parameter standard deviations, then displays the derived quantities with their standard deviations.

ss.rep - This report file is created between phases so, unlike Report.sso, will be created even if the hessian fails. It does not contain as much output as shown in Report.sso.

ss.cor - This is the standard ADMB report for parameter and standard deviation report correlations. It is in matrix form and challenging to interpret. This same information is reported in covar.sso.

\subsection{Stock Synthesis Summary}
The ss\_summary.sso file (available for versions 3.30.08.03 and later) is designed to put key model outputs all in one concise place. It is organized as a list. At the top of the file are descriptors, followed by the 1) likelihoods for each component, 2) parameters and their standard errors, and 3) derived quantities and their standard errors. Total biomass, summary biomass, and catch were added to the quantities reported in this file in v.3.30.11 and later.

Before v.3.30.17, TotBio and SmryBio did not always match values reported in columns of the TIME\_SERIES table of Report.sso. The report file should be used instead of ss\_summary.sso for correct calculation of these quantities before v.3.30.17. Care should be taken when using the TotBio and SmryBio if the model configuration has recruitment after January 1 or in a later season, as TotBio and SmryBio quantities are always calculated on January 1. Consult the detailed age-, area-, and season-specific tables in report.sso for calculations done at times other than January 1.

\subsection{SIS table}
The SIS\_table.sso is deprecated as of v.3.30.17. Please use the \hyperref[sec:r4ss]{r4ss} function \texttt{get\_SIS\_info()} instead. 

The SIS\_table.sso file contains model output formatted for reading into the NMFS Species Information System (\href{https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/sis/}{SIS}). This file includes an assessment summary for categories of information (abundance, recruitment, spawners, catch estimates) that are input into the SIS database. A time-series of estimated quantities which aggregates estimates across multiple areas and seasons are provided to summarize model results. Access to the SIS database is granted to all NOAA employees.

\subsection{Derived Quantities}
Before listing the derived quantities reported to the standard deviation report, there are a couple of topics that deserve further explanation.

\hypertarget{VirginUnfished}{}
\subsubsection{Virgin Spawning Biomass vs Unfished Spawning Biomass}
Unfished is the condition for which reference points (benchmark) are calculated. Virgin Spawning Biomass (B0) is the initial condition on which the start of the time-series depends. If biology or spawner-recruitment parameters are time-varying, then the benchmark year input in the forecast file tells the model which years to average in order to calculate ``unfished''. In this case, virgin recruitment and/or the virgin spawning biomass will differ from their unfished counterparts. Virgin recruitment and spawning biomass are reported in the mgmt\_quant portion of the sd\_report and are now labeled as ``unfished'' for clarity. Note that if ln(R0) is time-varying, then this will cause unfished to differ from virgin. However, if regime shift parameter is time-varying, then unfished will remain the same as virgin because the regime shift is treated as a temporary offset from virgin. Virgin spawning biomass is denoted as SPB\_virgin and spawning biomass unfished is denoted as SPB\_unf in the report file.

Virgin Spawning Biomass (B0) is used in four ways within SS3:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Anchor for the spawner-recruitment relationship as virgin spawning biomass.
	\item Basis for the initial equilibrium abundance. 
	\item Basis against which annual depletion is calculated.
	\item Benchmark calculations.
\end{enumerate}
However, if there is time-varying biology, then the 4th usage can have a different B0 calculation compared to the other usages.

\subsubsection{Metric for Fishing Mortality}
The implementation and reporting of fishing mortality, $F$, in SS3 is more complex than in simpler models and can be confusing. This description provides an overview of the ways in which $F$ is calculated, used, and reported.


\myparagraph{Nomenclature}

The nomenclature below ignores sex, morphs and areas for simplicity. The quantities associated with $F$ calculations are defined as:The quantities associated with $F$ calculations are defined as:

\begin{itemitze}
\item $f$ is fleet.
\item $t$ is a time step; continuous across years $y$ and seasons $s$; equivalent to year if only 1 season.
\item $a$ is age.
\item $C_{t,f}$ is fleet-specific catch in a time step.
\item $B_{t,f}$ is fleet specific available biomass, e.g., total biomass filtered by fleet-specific age selectivity, $s_{t,f,a}$.
\item $s_{t,f,a}$ is age-specific selectivity for a fleet. If selectivity is length-specific, then age-specific selectivity is calculated as the dot product across length bins of length selectivity and the normal (or lognormal) distribution of length-at-age. If selectivity is both length- and age-based, which is an entirely normal concept in SS3, then age selectivity due to length selectivity is calculated first, then multiplied by the direct age selectivity. This compound age selectivity is used in the mortality calculations and is reported as $Asel2$ in report:32 of report.sso. See appendix to \citet{methotstock2013} for more detail on this.
\item $F_{t,f}'$ is the fully-selected fishing mortality for a fleet. The manual will refer to it as $F’$ or $\text{full\_}F$. If your model is using $F'$s as parameters, then the parameter values are for $F'$.
\item $\text{apical\_}F$ is the maximum $F$ among the ages. It is not used explicitly in SS3 although some sections of the manual may state $\text{apical\_}F$ instead of the correct term, full\_$F$.
\item $F_{t,f,a}$ is age and fleet-specific fishing mortality rate equal to $F_{t,f}' * s_{t,f,a}$. Note that it is possible for no age to have a selectivity equal to 1.0. Some selectivity curves are forced to have maximum selectivity = 1.0 such that $\text{apical\_}F$ and $\text{full\_}F$ will be the same, but some curves never reach 1.0 and some non-parametric forms allow selectivity > 1.0. In all cases, $F'$ is still the rate for the hypothetical age that has selectivity equal to 1.0. The reported $F'$ values are not rescaled to be an $F$ for the age with peak selectivity. Users need to take this into account if they are comparing reported $F'$ values to reported vector of $F_{t,f,a}$ values.
\item $\text{ann}F_y$ is a measure of the total fishing intensity for a year, based on one of several user-specified options (see below).
\item $F\text{std}_y$ is a standardized measure of the total fishing intensity for a year and is reported in the derived quantities, so variance is calculated for this quantity. See below for how it relates to $\text{ann}F$.
\item SPR\_y is the equilibrium spawning biomass per recruit that would result from fishing at the current year’s $F$ level and selectivity.

\end{itemize}

Terminology and reporting of $\text{ann}F$ and $F\text{\_std}$ has been slightly revised for clarity in v.3.30.15.00 and the description here follows the new conventions.

\myparagraph{Equilibrium SPR}
This index focuses on the effect of fishing on the spawning potential of the stock. It is calculated as the ratio of the equilibrium reproductive output per recruit that would occur with the current year's F intensities and biology, to the equilibrium reproductive output per recruit that would occur with the current year's biology and no fishing. Thus it internalizes all seasonality, movement, weird selectivity patterns, and other factors. Because this index moves in the opposite direction than F intensity itself, it is usually reported as 1-SPR. A benefit of this index is that it is a direct measure of common proxies used for F\textsubscript{MSY}, such as F\textsubscript{40\%}. A shortcoming of this index is that it does not directly demonstrate the fraction of the stock that is caught each year. The SPR value is also calculated in the benchmarks (see below). 

The derived quantities report shows an annual SPR statistic. The options, as specified in the starter.ss file, are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = skip
	\item 1 = (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{TGT})
	\item 2 = (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{MSY})
	\item 3 = (1-SPR)/(1-SPR\textsubscript{Btarget})
	\item 4 = raw SPR
\end{itemize}

The SPR approach to measuring fishing intensity was implemented because the concept of a single annual $F$ does not exist in SS3 because $F$ varies by age, sex, and growth morph and season and area. There is no single $F$ value that is applied to all ages unless you create a very simple model setup with knife-edge selectivity. So, what you see in the options are various ways to calculate annual fishing intensity. They can be broken down into three categories. One is exploitation rate calculated simply as total catch divided by biomass from a defined age range. Another is SPR, which is a single measure of the equilibrium effect of fishing according to the $F$. The third category are various ways to calculate an average $F$. Some measures of fishing intensity will be misleading if applied inappropriately. For example, the sum of the $\text{apical\_}F$'s will be misleading if different fleets have very different selectivities or, worse, if they occur in different areas. The $F=Z-M$ approach to getting fishing intensity is a way to have a single $F$ that represents a number's weighted value across multiple areas, sexes, morphs, ages. An important distinction is that the exploitation rate and $F\text{-based}F$ approaches directly relate to the fraction of the population removed each year by fishing; whereas the SPR approach represents the cumulative effect of fishing so it's equivalent in $F$-space depends on $M$.

\myparagraph{$F\text{\_std}$}
This index provides a direct measure of fishing mortality. The options are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = skip
	\item 1 = exploitation(Bio)
	\item 2 = exploitation(Num)
	\item 3 = sum(Frates)
\end{itemize}
The exploitation rates are calculated as the ratio of the total annual catch (in either biomass or numbers as specified) to the summary biomass or summary numbers on January 1. The sum of the $F$ rates is simply the sum of all the $\text{apical\_}F$s. This makes sense if the F\_method is in terms of instantaneous $F$ (not Pope's approximation) and if there are not fleets with widely different size/age at peak selectivity, and if there is no seasonality, and especially if there is only one area.

$F\text{\_std}$ is a single annual value based on \hyperlink{annualF}{annual $F$($\text{ann}F$)} and the relationship to $\text{ann}F$ is specified by F\_report\_basis in the starter.ss file. The benchmark $\text{ann}F$ may be used to rescale the time series of $\text{ann}F$s to become a time series of standardized values representing the intensity of fishing, $F\text{\_std}$. The report basis (the available options for the denominator) is selected in the starter file as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = raw
	\item 1 = F/F\textsubscript {SPR}
	\item 2 = F/F\textsubscript {MSY}
	\item 3 = F/F\textsubscript {Btarget}
	\item >= 11   A new option to allow for the calculation of a multi-year trailing average in F was implemented in v.3.30.16. This option is triggered by appending the number of years to calculate the average across where an input of 1 or 11 would result in the SPR\textsubscript{target} with no changes. Alternatively a value of 21 would calculate F as SPR\textsubscript{target} with a 2-year trailing average.
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{$F\text{-at-age}$}
Because the annual $F$ is so difficult to interpret as a sum of individual $F$ components, an indirect calculation of $F\text{-at-age}$ is reported at the end of the report.sso file. This section of the report calculates $Z\text{-at-age}$ simply as $ln(N_{a+1,t+1}/N_{a,t})$. This is done on an annual basis and summed over all areas. It is done once using the fishing intensities as estimated (to get $Z$), and once with the $F$ intensities set to 0.0 to get $M\text{-at-age}$. This latter sequence also provides a measure of dynamic Bzero. The user can then subtract the table of $M\text{-at-age/year}$ from the table of $Z\text{-at-age/year}$ to get a table of $F\text{-at-age/year}$. From this $\text{apical\_}F$, average $F$ over a range of ages, or other user-desired statistics could be calculated. Further work within SS3 with this table of values is anticipated.

\myparagraph{$F$ Calculation}
SS3 allows for three approaches to estimate the $F'$ that will match the input values for retained catch. Note that SS3 is calculating the $F'$ to match the retained catch conditional on the fraction of total catch that is retained, e.g., the total catch is partitioned into retained and discarded portions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pope's method decays the numbers-at-age to the middle of the season, calculates a harvest rate for each fleet, $H_{t,f}$, that is the ratio of $C_{t,f}$ to $B_{t,f}$, then decays the survivors to the end of the season. The total mortality, $Z_{t,a}$, from the ratio of survivors to initial numbers, is then calculated. The $Z$ is subsequently used for in-season interpolation to get expected values for observations.
	
	\item $F$ as parameters uses the standard Baranov catch equation and lets ADMB find the $F'$ parameter values that produce the lowest negative log-likelihood, which includes fit to the input catch data. $F$ as parameters method tends to work better than Pope's or hybrid in high $F$ situations because it allows for some lac

	\item Hybrid $F$ starts by calculating a harvest rate, $H$, using Pope's method, then converts these $H$ values, which have units of fractional harvest rate, into an approximate of $F'$ in exponential units, tuning these $F'$ values over a few iterations to get a better match to each fleet's catch.
\end{enumerate}

Items to note:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SS3 includes a permutation on the $F$ as parameters method. In the first few phases, SS3 uses hybrid, then between phases it converts these directly calculated $F'$ values into parameters and proceeds in subsequent phases and MCMC to use the parameter approach. This variation on the parameter method is the recommend approach in high $F$ situations.

	\item With Pope's method, the $H$ values are fraction caught, so duration of the season does not matter. Parameter and hybrid treat $F'$ identically and multiply the $F'$ values by season duration (which has units of fraction of a year) as it is used. Each of the $F$ methods ends up with a $Z_{t,f}$ that is used for in-season interpolation.
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Relative $F$ and $F\text{mult}$}
The $F'$ is fleet-specific, so it is useful to have a concept of relative $F$, $\text{rel}F_f$, among fleets. In SS3, $\text{rel}F_f= F_{t,f}'/\sum_{f}^{}F_{t,f}'$ for a single time period $t$. In the benchmark and forecast routines, SS3 can calculate $\text{rel}F_f$ using $F_{t,f}'$ over a range of years, or the user can input custom $\text{rel}F$ values for benchmark and forecast in the forecast.ss file. Note that in a multi-season model setup, $\text{rel}F_f$ is implemented as $\text{rel}F_{s,f}$ where $s$ is the season. These get multiplied by season duration as they are used.

In the benchmark section of the code, SS3 searches for an $F\text{mult}$ to achieve various management reference points (often referred to as benchmarks). In this search, SS3 calculates a benchmark $F$ as $F_{ben,f}' = F\text{mult} * \text{rel}F_f$, then calculates equilibrium yield and spawning biomass per recruit (SPR). SS3 searches for the $F\text{mult}$ that satisfies the search conditions, first for user-specified SPR, then for user-specified spawning biomass at a management target (B\textsubscript{TGT} or $F_{0.1}$), then for MSY. The resultant benchmark quantities are reported in the derived quantities, but $F\text{mult}$ and $F_{ben,f}'$ are only reported in the Forecast\_report.sso file. SS3 stores the benchmark $F\text{mult}$ values so that user can invoke them for the forecast.

\hypertarget{annualF}{}
\myparagraph{Annual $F$}
The $\text{ann}F$ is a single annual value across all fleets and areas according to F\_report\_units, which is specified by users in the starter file. If there are many fleets, across several areas and with very different selectivity patterns, $\text{ann}F$ can have a complicated relationship to apical $F$. The F\_report\_units specification in the starter.ss file, see example line below, allows user to calculate it using $F'$ directly, use exploitation rate, or be derived from $Z$-at-age.

Example $F$ reporting unit specification in the starter.ss file:

\begin{center}
	\begin{longtable}{p{2cm} p{12cm}}
		\hline
		5 & \# F\_report\_units:\Tstrut\\
		  & 0 = skip; \\
		  & 1 = exploitation(Bio); \\
		  & 2 = exploitation(Num); \\ 
		  & 3 = sum(Frates); \\
		  & 4 = true F for range of ages; \\
		  & 5 = unweighted avg. F for range of ages. \Bstrut\\
		\hline
		3 7 & \# min and max age over which average F will be calculated \Tstrut\Bstrut\\
		\hline
	\end{longtable}
\end{center}

For options 4 and 5 of F\_report\_units, the $F$ is calculated as $Z-M$ where $Z$ is calculated as $ln(N_{t+1,a+1}/N_{t,a})$, thus $Z$ subsumes the effect of $F$.

The $\text{ann}F$ is calculated for each year of the estimated time series and of the forecast. Additionally, an $\text{ann}F$ is calculated in the benchmark calculations to provide equilibrium values that have the same units as $\text{ann}F$ from the time series. In versions previous to v.3.30.15, it was labeled inaccurately as $F\text{\_std}$ in the output, $\text{ann}F$. For example, in the Management Quantities section of derived quantities prior to v.3.30.15, there is a quantity labeled Fstd\_Btgt. This is more accurately labeled as the annual $F$ associated with the biomass target, ann\_F\_Btgt, in v.3.30.15

\myparagraph{Units for Stock Synthesis inputs related to $F$}
Below is a list of items to consider in terms of units for $F$ in SS3:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If F\_ballpark is specified in the control.ss file, its units are the same as $\text{ann}F$, so is not fleet-specific.
	
	\item $F$ as parameter values has units of fleet-specific apical $F'$.
	
	\item In the forecast.ss file there is an option to input a vector of $\text{rel}F$ values. These are dimensionless and will be rescaled to sum to 1.0.
	
	\item In the forecast.ss file there is an option to specify an $F$ scalar for the forecast.  The units of $F$ scalar are the same as the $F\text{mult}$ values calculated in benchmark. There are a full set of options for forecast $F$ scalar that can be selected in the forecast file 
	%(-1 = none; 0 = simple; 1 = F\textsubscript{SPR}; 2 = F\textsubscript{MSY} 3 = F\textsubscript{BTGT} or F\textsubscript{0.1}; 4 = Ave F (uses first-last relative F years); and 5 = input annual F scalar). 
	If the forecast $F$ scalar is set as $F_\text{SPR}$, then SS3 will use SPR\_Fmult calculated in benchmark and reported in Forecast-report.sso. If user selects the option to input an annual $F$ scalar, option 5, then the value is input on a following line. Whichever method the user selects for forecast $F$ scalar ($F\text{mult}$), SS3 will start the forecast by creating a fleet-specific vector of apical $F$ values from $F\text{mult}*\text{rel}F_f$.
	
	\item Also in the forecast.ss file, the last section of inputs allows for input of time and fleet specific apical $F_{t,f}'$ values that override the basic forecast $F$ specification described above.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MSY and other Benchmark Items}
The following quantities are included in the sdreport vector mgmt\_quantities, so obtain estimates of variance. Some additional quantities can be found in the benchmarks section of the forecast\_report.sso.

\end{center}

\subsection{Brief cumulative output}
Cum\_Report.sso: contains a brief version of the run output, which is appended to current content of file so results of several runs can be collected together. This is especially useful when a batch of runs is being processed. Unless this file is deleted, it will contain a cumulative record of all runs done in that subdirectory. The first column contains the run number.  

\hypertarget{bootstrap}{}
\subsection{Bootstrap Data Files}
It is possible to create bootstrap data files for SS3 where an internal parametric bootstrap function generates a simulated data set by parametric bootstrap sampling the expected values given the input observation error. Starting in v.3.30.19, bootstrap data files are output separated in single numbered files (e.g., data\_boot\_001.ss). In version prior to v.3.30.19 a single file called data.ss\_new was output that contained multiple sections:  the original data echoed out, the expected data values based on the model fit, and then subsequent bootstrap data files. 

Specifying the number of bootstrap data files has remained the same across model versions. Creating bootstrap data files is specified in the starter file via the ``Number of datafiles to produce'' line where a value of 3 or greater will create three files: the original data file, data\_echo.ss\_new, a data file with the model expected values, data\_expval.ss, and single bootstrap data file, data\_boot\_001.ss. The first output provides the unaltered input data file (with annotations added). The second provides the expected values for only the data elements used in the model run. The third and subsequent outputs provide parametric bootstraps around the expected values. 

The bootstrapping procedure within SS3 is done via the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Expected values of all input data are calculated (these are also used in the likelihood which compares observed to expected values for all data). The calculation of these expected values is described in detail under the ``Observation Model'' section of the appendix to \citet{methotstock2013}.
	
	\item Parametric bootstrap data are calculated for each observation by sampling from a probability distribution corresponding to the likelihood for that data type using the expected values noted above. Examples of how this happens include the following:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Indices of abundance are sampled from the distribution used in the estimation model (as set in the ``Errtype'' column of the index configuration, most commonly lognormal but could be normal or T-distribution). The variability of the distribution from which the random sample is drawn is based on the combination of the input uncertainty and any estimated ``Extra SD'' parameter and any ``add\_to\_survey\_CV'' value included under the input variance adjustments factors.
		
		\item Length and age compositions are sampled from multinomial distributions with expected proportions in each bin based on the expected values and sample size equal to the adjusted input sample size (input sample size multiplied by any inputs for ``mult\_by\_lencomp\_N'' or ``mult\_by\_agecomp\_N'' under the input variance adjustments factors).
		
		\item Discard data (fractions or absolute amounts) are generated from the chosen distribution (T-distribution, normal, log-normal, truncated-normal).
		
		\item Tagging data is generated using a negative binomial distribution to get the total number of recaptures for each tag group and a multinomial distribution to allocate those recaptures among fleets.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Given this, there are some assumptions implicit in the bootstrapping procedure (as implemented as of v.3.30.17) that users should be aware of:

\begin{itemize}

	\item This procedure is strictly an observation error approach (i.e., process error in recruitment or any other time-varying parameter is not added). For simulation analyses, a common approach has been to input a new time series of recruitment deviations for each bootstrap data set.
	
	\item The sample size for conditional age-at-length data matches the inputs for each length bin. If stratified sampling is used, this may be appropriate, but if the ages represent a random subset of the selected population, this may result in less variability than if the associated length distribution were resampled.
	
	\item Currently, the aging error matrix is multiplied by the expected distribution of proportions at age, while the more correct order of operations would be to sample true ages, and then sample the observed age including aging error (it is possible these are mathematically identical).
	
	\item Often there is need to explore the removal (not include in the model fitting) of specific years in a data set which can be done by specifying a negative fleet number. If bootstrapping a data file, note that specifying a negative fleet in the data inputs for indices, length composition, or age composition will include the ``observation'' in the model (hence generating predicted values and bootstrap data sets for the data), but not in the negative log likelihood. The ``observation values'' used with negative fleet do not influence the predicted values, except when using tail compression with length or age composition. Non-zero values greater than the minimum tail compression should be used for the observation values when tail compression is being used, as using zeros or values smaller than the minimum tail compression can cause the predicted values to be reported as zero and shift predictions to other bins.
	
	\item As of v.3.30.15, age and length composition data that use the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution in the model are generated using the Dirichlet-Multinomial in bootstrap data sets.

\subsection{Forecast and Reference Points (Forecast-report.sso)}
The Forecast-report file contains output of fishery reference points and forecasts. It is designed to meet the needs of the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, but it should be quite feasible to develop other regionally specific variants of this output.

The vector of forecast recruitment deviations is estimated during an additional model estimation phase. This vector includes any years after the end of the recruitment deviation time series and before or at the end year. When this vector starts before the ending year of the time series, then the estimates of these recruitments will be influenced by the data in these final years. This is problematic, because the original reason for not estimating these recruitments at the end of the time series was the poor signal/noise ratio in the available data. It is not that these data are worse than data from earlier in the time series, but the low amount of data accumulated for each cohort allows an individual datum to dominate the model's fit. Thus, an additional control is provided so that forecast recruitment deviations during these years can receive an extra weighting in order to counter-balance the influence of noisy data at the end of the time series.

An additional control is provided for the fraction of the log-bias adjustment to apply to the forecast recruitments. Recall that R is the expected mean level of recruitment for a particular year as specified by the spawner-recruitment curve and R' is the geometric mean recruitment level calculated by discounting R with the log-bias correction factor $e-0.5s^2$. Thus a lognormal distribution of recruitment deviations centered on R' will produce a mean level of recruitment equal to R. During the modeled time series, the virgin recruitment level and any recruitments prior to the first year of recruitment deviations are set at the level of R, and the lognormal recruitment deviations are centered on the R' level. For the forecast recruitments, the fraction control can be set to 1.0 so that 100\% of the log-bias correction is applied and the forecast recruitment deviations will be based on the R' level. This is certainly the configuration to use when the model is in MCMC mode. Setting the fraction to 0.0 during maximum likelihood forecasts would center the recruitment deviations, which all have a value of 0.0 in maximum likelihood mode, on R. Thus would provide a mean forecast that would be more comparable to the mean of the ensemble of forecasts produced in MCMC mode.  Further work on this topic is underway.

Note:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cohorts continue growing according to their specific growth parameters in the forecast period rather than staying static at the end year values.
	\item Environmental data entered for future years can be used to adjust expected recruitment levels. However, environmental data will not affect growth or selectivity parameters in the forecast.
\end{itemize}

The top of the Forecast-report file shows the search for F\textsubscript {SPR}  and the search for F\textsubscript {MSY}, allowing the user to verify convergence. Note: if the STD file shows aberrant results, such as all the standard deviations being the same value for all recruitments, then check the F\textsubscript {MSY} search for convergence. The F\textsubscript {MSY} can be calculated, or set equal to one of the other F reference points per the selection made in starter.ss.


\subsection{Main Output File, Report.sso}
This is the primary output file. Its major sections (as of v.3.30.16) are listed below.  

The sections of the output file are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item SS3 version number with date compiled. Time and date of model run. This info appears at the top of all output files.
	\item Comments
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Input file lines starting with \#C are echoed here.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Keywords
		\begin{itemize}
			\item List of keywords used in searching for output sections.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Definitions
		\begin{itemize}
			\item List of definitions (e.g., fleet names, model start year) assigned in the data and control files.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Likelihood
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Final values of the negative log(likelihood) are presented.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Input Variance Adjustments
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The matrix of input variance adjustments is output here because these values affect the log likelihood calculations.
		\end{itemize}
	\item{Parm deviations detail}
	    \begin{itemize}
		    \item Details about parameter deviations, if used in the model. Will be missing if no parameter devs were used.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Parameters
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The parameters are listed here. For the estimated parameters, the display shows: Num (count of parameters), Label (as internally generated by SS3), Value, Active\_Cnt, Phase, Min, Max, Init, Prior, Prior\_type, Prior\_SD, Prior\_Like, Parm\_StD (standard deviation of parameter as calculated from inverse Hessian), Status (e.g., near bound), and Pr\_atMin (value of prior penalty if parameter was near bound). The Active\_Cnt entry is a count of the parameters in the same order they appear in the ss.cor file.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Derived Quantities
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This section starts by showing the options selected from the starter.ss and forecast.ss input files:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item SPR ratio basis
					\item F report basis
					\item B ratio denominator
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Then the time series of output, with standard deviation of estimates, are produced with internally generated labels. Note that these time series extend through the forecast era. The order of the output is: spawning biomass, recruitment, SPRratio, Fratio, Bratio, management quantities, forecast catch (as a target level), forecast catch as a limit level (OFL), Selex\_std, Grow\_std, NatAge\_std. For the three ``ratio'' quantities, there is an additional column of output showing a Z-score calculation of the probability that the ratio differs from 1.0. The ``management quantities'' section is designed to meet the terms of reference for west coast groundfish assessments; other formats could be made available upon request. The standard deviation quantities at the end are set up according to specifications at the end of the control input file. In some cases, a user may specify that no derived quantity output of a certain type be produced. In those cases, SS3 substitutes a repeat output of the virgin spawning biomass so that vectors of null length are not created.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mortality and growth parameters by year after adjustments
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the time series of mortality and growth parameters by year after adjustments by environmental links, blocks and deviations.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Selectivity parameters (size) by year after adjustments

	\end{itemize}
	\item Recruitment Distribution
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the distribution of recruitment across growth patterns, sexes, birth seasons, and areas in the end year of the model.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Growth Morph Indexing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows the internal index values for various quantities. It can be a useful reference for complex model setups. The vocabulary is: Bio\_Pattern refers to a collection of cohorts with the same defined growth and natural mortality parameters; sex is the next main index. If recruitment occurs in multiple seasons, then birth season is the index for that factor. The index labeled ``Platoon'' is used as a continuous index across all the other factor-specific indices. If sub-platoons are used, they are nested within the Bio\_Pattern x Sex x Birth Season platoon. However, some of the output tables use the column label ``platoon'' as a continuous index across platoons and sub-platoons. Note that there is no index here for area. Each of the cohorts is distributed across areas and they retain their biological characteristics as they move among areas.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Size Frequency Translation
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the generalized size frequency approach is used, this block shows the translation probabilities between population length bins and the units of the defined size frequency method. If the method uses body weight as the accumulator, then output is in corresponding units.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Movement
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This block shows movement rate between areas in a multi-area model.
	\end{itemize}
