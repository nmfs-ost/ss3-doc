The specification of options for forecasts is contained in the mandatory input file named \texttt{forecast.ss}. See \hyperref[sec:forecast]{Forecast Module: Benchmark and Forecasting Calculations} for additional details. 

The term COND appears in the ``Typical Value'' column of this documentation (it does not actually appear in the model files) and indicates that the following section is omitted except under certain conditions, or that the factors included in the following section depend upon certain conditions. In most cases, the description in the definition column is the same as the label output to the ss\_new files.

Previously, fleets in the forecast period were required to have input catches at some amount during the modeled period. SS3 now has capability to have a fleet with no input catches during the modeled period that could be used as a fleet during the forecast.

\hypertarget{Benchmark}{}
\subsection[Benchmark Calculations]{\protect\hyperlink{Benchmark}{Benchmark Calculations}}
This feature of SS3 is designed to calculate an equilibrium fishing rate intended to serve as a proxy for the fishing rate that would provide maximum sustainable yield ($F_{MSY}$). Then in the forecast module these fishing rates can be used in the projections.

Four reference points can be calculated by SS3. The first is the estimate of $F_{MSY}$ within the model, while the other reference points use proxies or an alternative estimated point.

\begin{itemize}
	\item $F_{MSY}$: Search for the $F$ that produces maximum equilibrium (e.g., dead catch).
	
	\item $F_{SPR}$: Search for the $F$ that produces spawning biomass per recruit this is a specific fraction, termed $SPR_{TARGET}$, of spawning biomass per recruit under unfished conditions. Note that this is in relative terms so it does not take into account the spawner-recruit relationship.
	
	\item $F_{B_{TARGET}}$: Search for the $F$ that produces an absolute spawning biomass that is a specified fraction, termed relative biomass target, of the unfished spawning biomass. Note that this is in absolute terms so takes into account the spawner-recruit relationship. 
	
	\item $F_{0.10}$: Search for the $F$ that produces a slope in yield per recruit, $dY/dF$, that is 10\% of the slope at the origin. Note that with SS3, this option is mutually exclusive with $F_{B_{TARGET}}$. Only one will be calculated and the one that is calculated can serve as the proxy for $F_{MSY}$ and forecasting. The $F_{0.10}$ search can fail if bycatch fleets are used and the bycatch setting includes the fleet's catch in the catch to be optimized.
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Estimation}
Each of the potential reference points is calculated by searching across a range of $F$ multiplier levels, calculating equilibrium biomass and catch at that $F$, using Newton-Raphson method to calculate a better $F$ multiplier value, and iterating a fixed number of times to achieve convergence on the desired level.

\myparagraph{Calculations}
The calculation of equilibrium biomass and catch uses the same code that is used to calculate the virgin conditions and the initial equilibrium conditions. This equilibrium calculation code takes into account all morph, timing, biology, selectivity, and movement conditions as they apply while doing the time series calculations. You can verify this by running SS3 to calculate $F_{MSY}$ then hard-wire initial $F$ to equal this value, use the F\_method approach 2 so each annual $F$ is equal to $F_{MSY}$ and then set forecast $F$ to be the same $F_{MSY}$. Then run SS3 without estimation and no recruitment deviations. You should see that the population has an initial equilibrium abundance equal to $B_{MSY}$ and stays at this level during the time series and forecast.

\myparagraph{Catch Units}
For each fleet, SS3 always calculates catch in terms of biomass (mt) and numbers (1000s) for encountered (selected) catch, dead catch, and retained catch. These three categories differ only when some fleets have discarding or are designated as a bycatch fleet. SS3 uses total dead catch biomass as the quantity that is principally reported and the quantity that is optimized when searching for $F_{MSY}$. The quantity ``dead catch'' may occasionally be referred to as ``yield''.

\myparagraph{Biomass Units}
The principle measure of fish abundance, for the purpose of reference point calculation, is female reproductive output. This is referred to as \gls{ssb} and sometimes just ``B'' because the typical user settings have one unit of reproductive output (fecundity) per kg of mature female biomass. So when the output label says $B_{MSY}$, this is actually the female reproductive output at the proxy for $F_{MSY}$.

\myparagraph{Fleet Allocation}
An important concept for the reference point calculation is the allocation of fishing rate among fleets. Internally, this is benchmark years relative $F$ ($text{Bmark\_rel}F$ ($f,s$)) and it is the fraction of the $F$ multiplier assigned to each fleet, $f$ and season, $s$. The value, $F\text{mult} * \text{Bmark\_rel}F$($f,s$), is the $F$ level for a particular fleet in a particular season and for the age that has a selectivity of 1.0. Other ages will have different $F$ values according to their selectivity.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The $\text{Bmark\_rel}F$ values can be calculated by SS3 from a range of years specified in the input for Benchmark Years or it can be set to be the same as the Forecast\_RelF, which in turn can be based on a range of years or can be input as a set of fixed values.
	
	\item The biology years selected for the $\text{Bmark\_rel}F$ calculations can have an effect on the standard deviation estimated, even in models with no time-varying biology. It is recommended to use the first model year except when biology is time-varying. Note that when biology is time-varying, the fecundity vector, which is used to calculate \gls{ssb}, will be updated in every iteration for every year that has time-varying biology.
	
	\item Note for Bycatch Fleets: The forecast $F$ for a bycatch fleet is normally set in the \hyperlink{BycatchFleets}{bycatch setup in the data file} to be the average of a range of years or a fixed input value, but year-specific $F$ values can be set at the end of the forecast file in the \hyperlink{ForecastCatchInput}{Forecast catch input} section. If this is done, that $F$ value is not adjusted by changes to the $F$ multiplier. This allows the user to treat a bycatch fleet as a constant background $F$ while the optimal $F$ for other fleets is sought. Also, for bycatch fleets, there is user control for whether the dead catch from the bycatch fleet is included in the total dead catch that is optimized when searching for $F_{MSY}$.
  
\end{itemize}

\myparagraph{Virgin vs. Unfished Spawning Biomass}
The concept of unfished spawning biomass, (written as SSB\_unfished in SS3 input and output files), is important to the reference points calculations. Unfished spawning biomass can be potentially different from virgin spawning biomass (written as SSB\_virgin in SS3 output files).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Virgin spawning biomass is calculated from the parameter values associated with the start year of the model configuration and it serves as the basis from which the population model starts and the basis for calculation of stock depletion.
	
	\item Unfished spawning biomass can be calculated for any year or range of years, so can change over time as $R_{0}$, steepness, or biological parameters change.
	
	\item In the reference points calculation, the Benchmark Years input specifies the range of time over which the mean of various quantities are taken to calculate the reference points. For biology, selectivity, $F$s, and movement the mean values are the year-specific derived quantities. But for the stock-recruitment parameters ($R_{0}$ and steepness), the mean of the parameter values themselves is calculated over time.
	
	\item During the time series or forecast, the current year's unfished spawning output is used as the basis for the spawner-recruitment curve against which deviations from the spawner-recruitment curve are applied. So, if $R_{0}$ is made time-varying, then the spawner-recruit curve itself is changed. However, if the regime shift parameter is time-varying, then this is an offset from the spawner-recruitment curve and not a change in the curve itself. Changes in $R_{0}$ will change year-specific reference points and change the expected value for annual recruitments, but changes in regime shift parameter only change the expected value for annual recruitments.
	
	\item In reporting the time series of depletion level, the denominator can be based on virgin spawning output or $B_{MSY}$. Note that $B_{MSY}$ is based on unfished spawning output for the specified range of Benchmark years, not on virgin spawning biomass.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ProtectionLevel}{}
\subsection[Protection Level]{\protect\hyperlink{ProtectionLevel}{Protection Level}}
The protection level is used in conjunction with the control rule cutoff. If the control rule cutoff is negative, then the protection level is read and used as the biomass level below which $F$ is set to a very low value (0.0001). The usage of a protection level is illustrated in the figure below. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{ABC buffer versus relative stock size. The green line shows the ABC buffer for a target reference point of 0.4 SSB\textsubscript{0}, a limit reference point of 0.2 SSB\textsubscript{0}, and default ABC buffer of 0.85. The red line matches the green line, except there is a protection level at 0.3 SSB\textsubscript{0}.}

\hypertarget{ForeSpawn}{}
\subsection[Forecast Recruitment Adjustment]{\protect\hyperlink{ForeSpawn}{Forecast Recruitment Adjustment}}
Recruitment during the forecast years sometimes needs to be set at a level other than that determined by the spawner-recruitment curve. One way to do this is by an environmental or block effect on the regime shift parameter. A more straightforward approach is now provided by the special forecast recruitment feature described here. There are 4 options provided for this feature. These are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 0 = Do nothing: this is the default and will invoke no special treatment for the forecast recruitments.
	\item 1 = Multiplier on spawner-recruitment: the expected recruitment from the \gls{srr} is multiplied by this factor.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a multiplier, so null effect comes from a value of 1.0.
		\item The order of operations is to apply the \gls{srr}, then the regime effect, then this special forecast effect, then bias adjustment, then the deviations.
		\item In the spawner recruit output of the \texttt{Report.sso} there are 4 recruitment values stored.
	\end{itemize}
	\item 2 = Multiplier on virgin recruitment: The virgin recruitment is multiplied by this factor.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a multiplier, so null effect comes from a value of 1.0.
		\item The order of operations is to apply any environmental or block effects to $R_{0}$, then apply the special forecast effect, then bias adjustment, then the deviations.
		\item Note that environmental or block effects on $R_{0}$ are rare and are different from environment or block effects on the regime parameter.
	\end{itemize}
	\item 3 = Mean recent recruitment: calculate the mean recruitment and use it during the forecast period.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Note that bias adjustment is not applied to this mean because the values going into the mean have already been bias adjusted.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This feature affects the expected recruitment in all years after the last year of the main recruitment deviations. This means that if the last year of main recruitment deviations is before end year, then the last few recruitments, termed ``late'', are also affected by this forecast option. For example, option 3 would allow you to set the last 2 years of the time series and all forecast years to have recruitment equal to the mean recruitment for the last 10 years of the main recruitment era.
