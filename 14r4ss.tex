The R package \texttt{r4ss} includes tools for summarizing and plotting results, manipulating files, visualizing model parameterizations, and other tasks. Currently, information about \texttt{r4ss} can be found on \href{https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss}{Github}.  The software package is under continuous development to maintain compatibility with new versions of SS3 and to improve functionality.

The latest version of \texttt{r4ss} can be installed directly from GitHub at any time via the \texttt{remotes} package in R with the following commands:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{verbatim}
	> install.packages("remotes")
	> remotes::install_github("r4ss/r4ss")
	\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Once the \texttt{r4ss} package is installed, it can be loaded:

\begin{quote}
	\begin{verbatim}
	> library(r4ss)
	\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Two of the most commonly used functions for model diagnostics are \texttt{SS\_output} and \texttt{SS\_plots}. After running a model using SS, the output files including Report.sso can be read into R using the \texttt{SS\_output} function which stores quantities in a list with named objects.  This list can then be passed to the \texttt{SS\_plots} function, which creates a series of over 100 plots that are useful for visualizing output such as model fits to the data. For example, plots can be created using model output available in the directory "C:/myfiles/mymodels/myrun":

\begin{quote}
	\begin{verbatim}
	> base.model <- SS_output("C:/myfiles/mymodels/myrun")
	> SS_plots(base.model)
	\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
