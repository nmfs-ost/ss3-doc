The age-based process caused bias in the estimates of growth parameters assuming random at length, even when relatively few age classes were affected. Methods that assumed random at age were biased by the subsequent inclusion of the length-based process of gear selection. Additional knowledge of the age structure of the sampled area is needed to ensure an unbiased estimate of the growth parameters when using the length-conditional approach in the presence of age-based movement. Estimates of the variability in the length-at-age relationship were better estimated with the length-conditional than the traditional method even when the assumptions of random at length were violated. Inclusion of paired observations of length and associated age inside the population dynamics model may be the most appropriate way of estimating growth.},

Paired age-length data treated as conditional age-at-length (CAAL) data are increasingly being used as a data component in stock assessment models. The original intent of the use of CAAL data was to directly estimate the length-at-age process, including the associated variability in length-at-age. However, we show that introduction of CAAL data that are not representative of the age-structure of the population can cause bias and imprecision in estimates of not only growth, but also dynamics and management quantities. Estimation of an appropriate age-based observations-modeled process may improve model performance. We also show that even the use of representative CAAL data in a model with misspecified age-based systems-modeled processes (natural mortality and time-varying growth) can lead to bias and imprecision in growth, dynamics, and management quantities. In these cases, estimation of an age-based observations-modeled process magnified the bias and imprecision. Greater consideration of this type of data is needed.},

	abstract = {Selectivity is a key parameter in stock assessments that describes how ﬁsheries interact with different ages and sizes of ﬁsh. It is usually confounded with other processes (e.g., natural mortality and recruitment) in stock assessments and the assumption of selectivity can strongly affect stock assessment outcome. Here, we introduce a new semi-parametric selectivity method, which we implement and test in Stock Synthesis. This selectivity method includes a parametric component and an autocorrelated nonparametric component consisting of deviations from the parametric component. We explore the new selectivity method using two simulation experiments, which show that the two autocorrelation parameters for selectivity deviations of data-rich ﬁsheries are estimable using either mixed-effect or simpler sample-based algorithms. When selectivity deviations of a data-rich ﬁshery are highly autocorrelated, using the new method to estimate the two autocorrelation parameters leads to more precise estimations of spawning biomass and fully selected ﬁshing mortality. However, this new method fails to improve model performance in low data quality cases where measurement error in the data overwhelms the pattern caused by the autocorrelated process. Finally, we use a case study involving North Sea herring (Clupea harengus) to show that our new method substantially reduces autocorrelations in the Pearson residuals in ﬁt to age composition data.},

The function is used to develop a model in which both γ and the natural mortality rate M are formally indeterminate and in which the coming year's catch limit can be viewed as a response function of either estimated γ or estimated M. Decision theory is then used to derive the optimal catch. The optimal catch is shown to increase with the degree of uncertainty surrounding M, although this conclusion may depend on the short managerial time frame assumed. Three "suboptimal" strategies are also considered: (1) setting catch at the level corresponding to the expected value of M, (2) setting catch at the minimum of the response function, and (3) setting catch at the level corresponding to γ = 0. The first suboptimal strategy never results in a catch greater than the optimum and always results in a lower expected loss than the second. The performance of the third strategy (relative to the others) depends on parameter values.},
